    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions: <h1>
    <h2>ㅤㅤ</h2>
    <h1>Who Makes Your Products?</h1>
    <p>Woodland Metal Works takes pride in being the only student-led/run manufacturing company 
    in the United States; this includes all aspects of how the business is run and production 
    of our products.</p>
    <h2>ㅤㅤ</h2>
    <h1>Why Did Woodland Metal Works Start?</h1>
    <p>The Woodland Timber Team was in constant search for companies that would provide the range
    of items needed to participate in all timber sports. Eventually, the Timber Team made a 
    relationship with Woodland Metal Work's parent company, Precision Axes. The owners of Precision
    Axes generously donated the axe production if their business to the Timber Team and Woodland 
    Regional High School.</p>
    <h2>ㅤㅤ</h2>

    <h2>ㅤㅤ</h2>
    <h1>What Happens When The School Year/Semster Ends?</h1>
    <p>Woodland Metal Works has to adapt and train the new students to provide the proper skills to run 
    Woodland Metal Works as effciently as possible. </p>
    <h2>ㅤㅤ</h2>
    <h1>How Are the Students Compensated?</h1>
    <p>Connecticut State Law does not permit students be compensated monetarily. However, all students
    who participate in the company attain experience and knowledge free of charge. They can include it 
    as part of their college applications and on their resume to put them ahead of the competition.</p>
    <h2>ㅤㅤ</h2>
    <h1>How do I order?</h1>
    <p>Due to WMW's unique situation (i.e. headquartered in a high school and having to adhere to guidelines 
    pretaining to it), we are unable to allow customers to directly order from the website. So, in order to 
    order you must contact us directly; whether that be email or phone. However, we do recommend emailing
    because the hours at which the phone can be answered are very limited.</p>
